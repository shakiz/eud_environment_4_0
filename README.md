## Background
The thing which most effects our life is IOT services. It just making our life simpler and easier because it provides the simplicities and functionalities that we need in our 
life. When we say IOT it just does not mean only the hardware devices rather it summarizes the relation between both the hardware and software because they are both dependent and
can work simultaneously. But most of the services that we used like home automation, office managerial etc. these things are provided by some companies. 
They provide these solutions. Every different company has different services that they offer to their user. But all these services are rigid. By rigid we 
meant that these services are not configurable by the user themselves. And the main thing to point here is there no existing technology that satisfies the adaptation of 
environment of a system. Adding with that, only the professionals who has the knowledge to alter those devices can perform the configuration. So user has this uncomfortable 
zone not being configure his/her own services.

## Objective 
The purpose of this thesis work is to provide an end-user an adaptive environment where the system can listen or observe any kind of environment changes. We tried to build 
an architecture which will adopt the changes that occurs into an environment. An adaptive application provides user the desired output by looking up the context values or 
whatâ€™s the current context of the services that user uses.
